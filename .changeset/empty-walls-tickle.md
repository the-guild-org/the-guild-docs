fix this weird thing that does not cause any runtime errors within the example app in this repo but breaks graphql-yoga.

**Original error**

```
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.

Check the render method of `Pagination`.
```
